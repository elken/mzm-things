# mzm-things

Various hacks &amp; shit for Metroid Zero Mission


## mzm-random


A project that was brought up on m2k2 that I stumbled upon whilst making my auto-splitter for livesplit, until I found no API docs :(

Nevertheless, this came out of it, and while it is *extremely* primitive, I expect good things.

## mzm-interfacing-thing-with-a-shit-name

Self-explanatory really, extremely primitive and ugly-looking interface to access mzm via VBA-RR (for now).
