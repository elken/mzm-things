Sort-of blog thing I guess idk
======================

It could be a changelog of sorts, I'm too lazy to maintain a proper one.

First try of rng items caused a segfault if I call the function via registerwrite, so I assume it's making more than 1 write. The lua method is proving more difficult for no payout. Putting on the back-burner for now in favour of the straight ROM hack.
