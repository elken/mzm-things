Sort-of blog thing I guess idk
======================

It could be a changelog of sorts, I'm too lazy to maintain a proper one.

First try of rng items caused a segfault if I call the function via registerwrite, so I assume it's making more than 1 write. The lua method is proving more difficult for no payout. Putting on the back-burner for now in favour of the straight ROM hack.

Still given up on random for now, added my primitive c++ vba interface program thing so I can try and hack a Linux version soon. Will use the logic gained from this program to finish mwm & my split thing so that's good.
